August noon
Not yet dried flower in a glass as a good friend who has a very limited space. It's easy to imagine someone spending the whole day with it at home writing the most important mail they could ever think.

ID 227884097 Refused on 08/22/2021
Refusal reason:


Your image might not be suitable as a stock image because of one or more of the following reasons:
We have reviewed your file and this is not quite what we're looking for. Please note that this image is not eligible for resubmission.
Image is not RF stock oriented or its sales potential is too low at this stage. Please note that Stock photography is a commercial type of imagery, so, snapshots are not Stock. It is also very important to understand that Art and Stock are two fundamentally different categories of imagery, that only meet when an artwork can adapt to a wide range of commercial usage.
Lack of concept.
This event is too old and no longer presents interest in the editorial section.
Your image might have one or more of the following technical issues:
Distorted pixels, image was interpolated, poorly scanned, upsampled, oversharpened, overprocessed/ overfiltered or JPG was not saved at the highest quality.
The composition of a successful commercial image needs to be clear and supportive of the image's main concept and primary subject. A good composition is one that does not limit designers' potential usage of the image (for instance, a tight crop). Engaging the classical rules of composition, such as the rule of thirds, the golden ratio or a supportive use of negative space may help you to produce good commercial images.
Poor lighting due to lighting conditions (wrong time of day, dull skies, harsh shadows etc.) and/or camera limitations / Poor contrast or incorrect exposure.
Please improve the technical execution (distorted pixels, noise, blending, DOF, color corection, background removal, white balance, dust on the camera sensor, etc.)
Illustration is poorly executed. Please pay attention to: poorly traced/autotraced and scanned images, noise and inaccurate texturing on 3D renders, aliased/jagged lines, banding effect on gradients, noise/distorted pixels on various textures and images used within the illustration, unwanted orphan stripes/lines across your illustration, blurry illustration due to software upsampling or interpolation.
This image was not uploaded completely and cannot be reviewed. Please reupload it. Once uploaded, make sure the thumbnail of the image does not contain horizontal color error lines, gray areas (with no content visible) or is not entirely gray.
Image is out of focus or too much of the subject is out of focus (DOF too shallow or DOF not justified) / Image is shaken. Use a faster speed or a tripod. Please check the files at 100% zoom before submitting them.
The area occupied by the isolated subject is too small, and by cropping the resulting image is under 3 Megapixels.
Image was not saved as sRGB or Adobe RGB
