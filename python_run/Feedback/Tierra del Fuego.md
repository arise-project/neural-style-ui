Land of Fire
Their other members have died. Those who are left will have a long time to sail to Land of Fire. It goes against the goal they set for themselves, and is their own fault.

Refusal reason:


Your image might have one or more of the following info issues:
Your image info contains one or more of the following issues: irrelevant or incomplete title, description/keywords/categories issues, similar/identical title and description, title/description written with capital letters(CAPS LOCK ON), MR for an image with no persons. Use only keywords that are the most relevant and specific to the image subject. Take your time for each image and provide individual, accurate, relevant and comprehensive information.
If the image was taken during a news event, please include in the description all location/date details. All celebrities' names should be mentioned as well as names for participants/winners in competition related images and musicians/bands in concert related images or any other information that would specifically describe the image particularities.
There are misspelled words in the title, description and/or keywords of your image (or IN your image) OR the info submitted is in a language other than English. Please resubmit and fix this problem or use the Keymasters program. Make sure to verify the spelling using the spellcheck buttons placed at the right of the description and keywords areas.
The info you provided for this image is too general. Please be more specific about locations, landmark names and flora/fauna species. Also try to explain briefly what makes your image stand out or significant as compared to the ones already online.
Your image might have one or more of the following technical issues:
Distorted pixels, image was interpolated, poorly scanned, upsampled, oversharpened, overprocessed/ overfiltered or JPG was not saved at the highest quality.
The composition of a successful commercial image needs to be clear and supportive of the image's main concept and primary subject. A good composition is one that does not limit designers' potential usage of the image (for instance, a tight crop). Engaging the classical rules of composition, such as the rule of thirds, the golden ratio or a supportive use of negative space may help you to produce good commercial images.
Poor lighting due to lighting conditions (wrong time of day, dull skies, harsh shadows etc.) and/or camera limitations / Poor contrast or incorrect exposure.
Please improve the technical execution (distorted pixels, noise, blending, DOF, color corection, background removal, white balance, dust on the camera sensor, etc.)
Illustration is poorly executed. Please pay attention to: poorly traced/autotraced and scanned images, noise and inaccurate texturing on 3D renders, aliased/jagged lines, banding effect on gradients, noise/distorted pixels on various textures and images used within the illustration, unwanted orphan stripes/lines across your illustration, blurry illustration due to software upsampling or interpolation.
This image was not uploaded completely and cannot be reviewed. Please reupload it. Once uploaded, make sure the thumbnail of the image does not contain horizontal color error lines, gray areas (with no content visible) or is not entirely gray.
Image is out of focus or too much of the subject is out of focus (DOF too shallow or DOF not justified) / Image is shaken. Use a faster speed or a tripod. Please check the files at 100% zoom before submitting them.
The area occupied by the isolated subject is too small, and by cropping the resulting image is under 3 Megapixels.
Image was not saved as sRGB or Adobe RGB
